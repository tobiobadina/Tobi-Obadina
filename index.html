<h1>Digital Artefact Creation 

  Individual analysis:
I believe that technology has become quite important in my everyday life, 
  influencing the way I think about things, communicate, and complete even the simplest of tasks.
  Looking back at things the first thing in the day that I will do is pick up my phone and use all sorts of technology before getting out of bed.
  One of the most significant impacts of technology has had on me is the way it improves my communication. I can instantly message friends and family or call them, making it feel like distance barely matters anymore. In school, technology has also changed the way teachers and students teach and learn in a classroom, instead of relying only of textbooks, we can watch tutorials, read articles, or access online notes whenever I want. This has made studying easier and I'm able to work at my own pace.
  Even simple tasks like checking the weather or navigating your way through and unfamiliar place using google maps for example are extremely useful forms of technology that we just take for granted. In my free time, digital entertainment provides endless options, whether I want to to stream a film, play a game on PlayStation or just use social media. However, I also recognise that technology can be extremely distracting, and sometimes I spend more time on my phone than planned.
  Hackers also have the option to hack your devise or steel your personal information if you are not careful with it and my use it to blackmail or take advantage of you. Even with these challenges, I feel that the benefits outweigh the negatives, because technology halps me stay connected, informed, and efficient. Overall, technology has not just changed my routine, it has shaped the way I live, learn and interact with the world around me.

- my role is Positive Impacts of technology in everyday life 

  Research - why did you decide to build this on this topic, with this content? 

  I chose to focus my analysis on this topic because technology has a daily impact on my life, so I can speak from personal experience. 
  The content I included reflects the aspects of my life such as communication, education and entertainment - where I believe technology as a massive impact on. 
Since I deal with these things all the time, they have opened my mind to how technology effects my daily activities. Instead of writing something overly broad or from websites all the time, 
  I was able to provide a more genuine and relatable explanation of how technology impacts me personally by concentrating on these particular elements.  

  
  Design - how did you agree/design what it would be - why text and not audio, why a timeline rather than a podcast, why do a 3D model or a scan, 
  why create a video rather than a website?  

  We decided to create a PowerPoint presentation for our project but also create a podcast where we talk about all the different things that we put on our project essentially. 

  Implementation - how did it work - how successful is it in achieving your initial research goal? 
We just recorded ourselves talking about what we put on our project in the form of a podcast.
  I genuinely was curious about the different impacts of technology in our everyday lives and after researching about it I now realise just how often we use technology and how valuable it is to us. 
  I also realised how much we take it for granted as we would not thrive without the technology we use today. Same with every other thing in life when you have positives you will always have negatives that follow.
  Overall, i was quite happy with my research and glad that I now perceive just how much technology we use in our lives.
